# Story
Backstory


This game is a story of a time man has only dreamed of, with advancements in technology where everything was almost possible. Voltic is a leading city in these advancements and practiced a Democratic system on paper, while in reality the elites of the city had control of everything down to the private data of citizens, who is elected into power, decided economic and financial outcomes. The Voltic government also heavily surveilled its citizens.

The elites believed that not everyone should have a say in the faith of the city, and would use any means necessary to protect the centralized power of the city.

 On the other side of the city, some public good evangelists are pushing for a decentralized system of governance where everyone's voices would count, elections can be openly conducted and an open monetary system that included everyone, they had a powerful network, Etherium and a community that believes this is better for the city.

The government are slowly losing their power as the community that believed the evangelists grows every day.

The only chance the government has in taking down this public network was to execute a Sybil attack(a forceful takeover) on the network and take control of the whole network,  with heavy investments on high grade hardware and abundance of resources, this plan looks promising to the officials leading this effort. 
Young was the data scientist leading a team that worked on deploying data centers for this attack but has joined the public good efforts as his wife Eva goes missing, and he discovers she is an evangelist working on a robot car software and helping public good. Eva went missing after delivering the software to the evangelists.

The evangelists are on a mission to frustrate the governments efforts and prevent this attack leveraging the power of the robot car that has been developed by a team of public good individuals (notably Austin and Vera with other anonymous contributors which included Eva), to go against the state and shutdown or convert government data centers to good nodes in the public network.

Who takes control of Etherium?
