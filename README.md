# Story
Backstory


This game is a story of a time man has only dreamed of, with advancements in technology where everything was almost possible. Voltic is a leading city in these advancements and practiced a Democratic system on paper, while in reality the elites of the city had control of everything down to the private data of citizens, who were elected into power and essentially decided the economic situation of the city.

The elites believed that not everyone should have a say in the faith of the city, and would use any means necessary to protect the centralized power of the city.

 On the other side of the city, some public good evangelists are pushing for a decentralized system of governance where everyone's voices would count and elections can be openly conducted and an open monetary system that included everyone, they had a network, Etherium and a community that believes this was the best for the city.

The government are slowly losing their power as the community that believed the evangelists grow every day.

The only chance the government has in taking down this public network Etherium was to execute a Sybil attack on the network and take control of the whole network,  with heavy investments on high grade hardware and abundance of resources, this plans looks promising to the team leading this effort. Young is a data scientist that leads the team that worked on deploying data centers for this attack but had to join the public good efforts as his wife goes missing, and he discovers she is an evangelist working on a robot car software and helping public good. Eva went missing after delivering the software to the evangelists.

The evangelists are on a mission to frustrate the government and prevent this attack and use the power of the robot car that has been developed by a team of public good guys, notably Austin and Vera with other anonymous contributors which included Eva, to go against the state and convert government data centers to good nodes in the public network.

Who takes control of Etherium?
